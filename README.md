## Installation  
  
No installation necessary. Just visit the link to the deployed app on Heroku in the [Usage](#usage) section below and sidestep installation altogether!  
  
## Usage  
  
The user can add as many exercises to as many workouts as they need to in a day. Once they've entered at least out workout, the app will track their totals both on the homepage (last workout summary) and through live charts on the dashboard (7-day totals).  
  
Check out the [deployed app](https://arcane-shelf-58681.herokuapp.com/) at Heroku.
